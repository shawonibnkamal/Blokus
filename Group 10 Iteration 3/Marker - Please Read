The two use cases for this iteration were not fully implemented due to them being more difficult than anticipated.
The player is able to place only a 1 by 1 blue piece. In order for the other pieces to be placeable, there needs to be a 
turn manager which had not been planned for yet. The rotate piece was also not implemented in this iteration.
